# Movie Dashboard - Explore & Discover Your Favorite Movies
The Movie Dashboard is a sleek and interactive web application designed to help users explore, search, and discover movie details effortlessly. Built with React and powered by the OMDb API, this dashboard provides real-time information on movie ratings, cast, plot summaries, and more. With a user-friendly interface and seamless navigation, users can browse through a vast collection of films, find trending movies, and get personalized recommendations. Whether you're a cinephile or just looking for your next watch, the Movie Dashboard is your go-to platform for all things cinema!


## 1. Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Rohitjha17/movie-dashboard.git
cd movie-dashboard

2. Install dependencies:
npm install 

3. Run code:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\



You may also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
